# Chapter 3 Exercise 3.26

Consider the unbounded version of the regular 2D grid shown in Figure 3.9. The start
state is at the origin, (0,0), and the goal state is at (x, y).

    a. What is the branching factor b in this state space?

        The branching factor b in the state space is 4. This is because at node (0,0) in the initial state, there are 4 possible states to transition to (4 other nodes that can be reached in other words).

    b. How many distinct states are there at depth k (for k > 0)? **

        At depth 1, we know that there are 4 distinct states (the current frontier at depth 1) because 4 new nodes have been expanded from the root node as shown in phase a.
        At depth 2, we know that there are 8 distinct states (the current frontier ar depth 2) because 8 new nodes have been expanded from the 4 distinct states as shown in phase c.
        At depth k for k > 0, there are (4 * k) distinct states.

    c. What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first tree search? **

        Breadth-first search expands all successors of the current node.
        For a tree search, we can visit the same node multiple times.
        For a solution at depth 1, there is a maximum of 4 nodes that can be expanded from the root node.
        For a solution at depth 2, there is a maximum of 16 nodes that can be expanded including the 4 nodes expanded from the root node. 
        As part of running the goal test on a tree, the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first tree search is the branching factor raised to the depth of the solution, which can be written as 4^(x + y) in this scenario. x + y always sums to the depth/level of the solution in the tree.

    d. What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first graph search? **

        For a graph search, we cannot visit the same node multiple times.
        For a solution at depth of 1, there is a maximum of 5 distinct states that have been explored.
        For a solution at depth of 2, there is a maximum of 13 distinct states that have been explored.

        The maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first graph search according to the set of explored states is 1 + 2(x + y)(x + y + 1) where x + y is equal to the current depth.

    e. Is h = |u − x| + |v − y| an admissible heuristic for a state at (u, v)? Explain.

        Heuristic function h(n) = estimated cost of the cheapest path from the state at node n to a goal state.
        We know that a heuristic function is admissible if it never overestimates the cost to reach a goal.

        Yes, h = |u - x| + |v - y| is an admissible heuristic function. This is because the heuristic function calculates the cheapest grid distance between a state at (u, v) and the goal state. This heuristic will never overestimate the distance between these two states because the only directions that can be used to move through the grid are up, down, left, and right. For exmaple, it is impossible to move diagonally from initial (0,0) to goal state (1,1). The heuristic function calculates the cheapest path, which in this case is 2. 

    f. How many nodes are expanded by A∗ graph search using h?

        When using A* graph search using heuristic h, we are really computing a best-first search using evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n) where g(n) is the path cost from the initial state to node n and h(n) is the heuristic function.
        Therefore, we know that x + y nodes are expanded using A* graph search with heuristic h. x + y is always equal to the length of the cheapest/shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.

    g. Does h remain admissible if some links are removed?

        If some links on the grid are removed, h does indeed remain admissible. Since the basic four directions of exploring the grid (up, down, left, right) are still present, h will still estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the state at node n to a goal state, which also means that in certain cases, h(n) will underestimate the cost of the cheapest path, which is perfectly fine.
        Even if h(n) underestimates the cost of the cheapest path, it still remains admissible as it still will never overestimate the cost to reach the goal state.

    h. Does h remain admissible if some links are added between nonadjacent states?

        h does not remain admissible if some links are added between nonadjacent states. 
        Reasoning: If some links are added between nonadjacent states, then this means that some states will be connected through diagonal links (as all adjacent states are connected through either vertical or horizontal links). If the initial state is (0,0) and the goal state is (1,1) for instance, then h will still produce a path length estimate of 2 while the cheapest path length is actually 1. Thus, there is at least one case where the heuristic h overestimates the cost to reach a goal state from the initial state, which means that h cannot be admissible.
